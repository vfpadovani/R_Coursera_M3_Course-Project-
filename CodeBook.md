# Course Project CodeBook

This CodeBook contains the steps I took to clean and tidy the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartfones** data set. For a full description of the data visit [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).  

The data was downloaded from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>.
